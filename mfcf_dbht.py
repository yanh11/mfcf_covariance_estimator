"""
Tools for performing Direct Bubble Hierarchical Tree (DBHT) clustering
using a Maximal Filtering Clique Forest (MFCF) backbone.

This module replaces the TMFG graph-construction step in the original
riskfolio DBHT implementation with an MFCF-based builder, improving
flexibility via tunable clique sizes, a gain threshold, and an optional
cap on separator reuse.

Functions
---------
mfcf_dbhts
    Run DBHT on a similarity matrix S (and the corresponding dissimilarity
    matrix D), returning cluster assignments, the filtered graph, and the
    resulting hierarchical linkage.

_convert_cliques_to_adjacency
    Helper to convert a list of cliques into a weighted adjacency matrix
    using weights from S.

    """
    Perform Direct Bubble Hierarchical Tree (DBHT) clustering with an
    MFCF-generated backbone graph.

    This function is a drop-in alternative to the TMFG-based DBHT pipeline in
    riskfolio. It constructs a filtered graph using the Maximal Filtering
    Clique Forest (MFCF) algorithm and then applies the standard DBHT steps to
    produce deterministic, parameter-light hierarchical clusters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : ndarray of shape (N, N)
        Dissimilarity matrix (non-negative). Typical choices include pairwise
        distances such as ``squareform(pdist(X, metric='euclidean'))``.

    S : ndarray of shape (N, N)
        Similarity matrix (non-negative), consistent with ``D``. Examples:
        a correlation-based affinity, ``S = 1 / (1 + D / D.mean())``, or
        ``S = exp(-D)``. Only the relative magnitudes matter.

    leaf_order : bool, default=True
        If ``True``, apply optimal leaf ordering to the linkage to reduce
        crossings and improve dendrogram readability.

    threshold : float, default=0.0
        Gain threshold controlling whether a vertex attaches to an existing
        component versus spawning a new component during MFCF construction.

    min_clique_size : int, default=1
        Minimum clique size allowed in the MFCF graph.

    max_clique_size : int, default=4
        Maximum clique size allowed in the MFCF graph.

    coordination_number : float, default=np.inf
        Maximum allowed uses of a separator (multiplicity cap) during MFCF.

    Returns
    -------
    T8 : ndarray of shape (N,)
        Cluster labels obtained from DBHT.

    Rpm : ndarray of shape (N, N)
        Weighted adjacency of the filtered graph (edges weighted by ``S``; zero
        on the diagonal).

    Adjv : ndarray
        Bubble-cluster adjacency as produced by ``BubbleCluster8s``.

    Dpm : ndarray of shape (N, N)
        All-pairs shortest-path distances on the filtered graph.

    Mv : ndarray of shape (N, Nb)
        Bubble membership matrix where ``Mv[n, b] = 1`` if vertex ``n`` belongs
        to bubble ``b``.

    Z : ndarray of shape (N-1, 4)
        Linkage matrix encoding the DBHT hierarchy (compatible with
        ``scipy.cluster.hierarchy`` utilities).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``D`` or ``S`` is not square or the shapes are inconsistent.

    Notes
    -----
    - Deterministic given ``S`` and MFCF hyperparameters.
    - The result can be used with ``scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster`` to obtain
      a flat clustering at a chosen number of clusters or distance threshold.
